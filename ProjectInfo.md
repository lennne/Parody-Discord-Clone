1. Creating your next.js project. Run "npx create-next-app@latest discord-video --typescript --tailwind --eslint".
2. Creating organizational folders:
    To do that use "(auth)" and this will create an organizational folder named (auth) and this will have no effect on your url route/path. Therefore you can access the "LoginPage" inside the login folder as "localhost:3000/login" just as you would the "TestPage" inside the "Test" folder.
3. Expanding on point 2, when we have an organizational folder, an example of what we can do is create a layout file and this can set features or properties for the pages inside the various folders "register" and "login". For example when we create an AuthLayout inside the layout file and set a div with a className having a color attribute as red while passing the children. All the pages(children) in the folder then have the property that was assigned.
4. You can create a new organizational folder named (routes) and move your login and register folder into it. You might wonder whether this will still work, it will. Nextjs will still find your pages and work normally.
5. NB: when using clerk, you need to navigate to the guides and copy the middleware.ts content.
